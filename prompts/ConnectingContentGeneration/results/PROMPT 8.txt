Create an indirect connection between the two topics using the provided facts. The connection should leave room for curiosity and exploration, without providing a clear resolution.

Topic 1: Ari's objective
Facts from topic 1:
-Ari is looking for a rare flower to help his sick father
-The flower is called Purunima Alidima
-The flower only grows in hot climates
-The flower is very rare
-Ari's mother is taking care of his father

Topic 2: Sagim (Settlement)
Facts from topic 2:
-Sagim is a small rural town
-Sagim has a mining operation going on nearby
-Sagim's main export is their minerals

Connection:
It seems that finding the rare flower may not be easy, but perhaps Ari will have to travel to a hot climate, like the one where the flower grows, in order to find it. Perhaps he will have to go to the mine in Sagim, which could potentially lead him to the location of the flower. Or maybe, the people of Sagim know something about the flower and can provide information or assistance to Ari in his search.
