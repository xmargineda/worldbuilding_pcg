We have a set of information about a world, inside of which we are trying to create a narrative. We want to create a connection between two elements of our narrative to make the story move forward. Create a list of concise, self-contained facts that give an idea of an original connection between the two topics using the provided facts you deem useful. The connection should not contradict the restricting facts.

Topic 1: 
-Ari's objective: Ari is looking for a rare flower to help his sick father
Facts from topic 1:
-The flower is called Purunima Alidima
-The flower only grows in hot climates
-The flower is very rare
-Ari's mother is taking care of his father

Topic 2: 
-Sagim (Settlement)
Facts from topic 2:
-Sagim is a small rural town
-Sagim has a mining operation going on nearby
-Sagim's main export is their minerals

Restricting Facts:
- The Purunima Alidima is not in the town of Sagim

Connection:
-Ari heard about the Purunima Alidima while talking with some people who were passing through Sagim and mentioned they had seen it growing near one of the mines. They told him that if he ever needed any help finding it again, he could ask around in Sagim because many of the workers at the mine knew where it grew.
