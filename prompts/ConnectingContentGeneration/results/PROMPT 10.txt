-The flower is called Purunima Alidima
-The flower only grows in hot climates
-The flower is very rare

Topic 2: Sagim (Settlement)
Facts from topic 2:
-Sagim is a small rural town
-Sagim has a mining operation going on nearby
-Sagim's main export is their minerals

Restricting Facts:
- The Purunima Alidima is not in the town of Sagim

Connection:
Despite the fact that the Purunima Alidima is not found in the town of Sagim, there may be other reasons why Ari would choose to go to Sagim. Perhaps he heard about the mining operations and believes that the workers might have come across the flower during their work. Or maybe he knows someone who lives in Sagim who can provide him with information or assistance in finding the flower. Whatever the reason, it seems like Ari is determined to find the flower and will stop at nothing to do so.
