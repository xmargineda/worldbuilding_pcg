Text: Nott was born a halfling, Revvetha "Veth" Smyt'hh, in the town of Felderwin. Growing up, she was often ridiculed for her peculiarities, which made it difficult for her to fit in, and she had abusive older siblings that used to chase her through the woods, lock her up or dunk her head in the water as "jokes". One day Veth met a halfling man named Yeza Brenatto through a game of truth or dare, and eventually they fell in love. They were later married and had a son, Luc. About three and a half years after Luc's birth, the family was kidnapped by a local goblin clan led by a couple, Drekkit and Khaaz. After being held there for weeks, Veth helped her family to escape, letting her son and husband run ahead while luring their captors away. She was cornered by the goblins and threw a vial of acid in their leader's face, killing him.

Text: In the year 1999, a young boy named David was living in a small village near the coastal mountains when he witnessed something strange. It seemed like a giant bird was flying overhead, except this creature didn't have wings; instead, it had two large stone spheres attached to its back. This odd sight was followed by a loud booming sound, then suddenly the sky turned dark grey and began pouring rain. Terrified, David watched as the bird flew towards the ocean until it disappeared beneath the waves. Strangest
