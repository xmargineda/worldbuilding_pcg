Text: Nott was born a halfling, Revvetha "Veth" Smyt'hh, in the town of Felderwin. Growing up, she was often ridiculed for her peculiarities, which made it difficult for her to fit in, and she had abusive older siblings that used to chase her through the woods, lock her up or dunk her head in the water as "jokes". One day Veth met a halfling man named Yeza Brenatto through a game of truth or dare, and eventually they fell in love. They were later married and had a son, Luc. About three and a half years after Luc's birth, the family was kidnapped by a local goblin clan led by a couple, Drekkit and Khaaz. After being held there for weeks, Veth helped her family to escape, letting her son and husband run ahead while luring their captors away. She was cornered by the goblins and threw a vial of acid in their leader's face, killing him. The goblins recaptured Veth, and Drekkit's widow, Khaaz, took her to an old spellcaster, Isharnai, with instructions to "make her suffer".

Text: In the year 1000, the world was ruled over by four great empires: the Empire of the Sun, the Empire of the Moon, the Empire of the Stars, and the Empire of the Night. These Empires were divided amongst themselves, and no single ruler could claim dominion over two different ones. However, this balance between power was threatened when the Emperor of the Night died without any direct heir. His death sparked a civil war among the other emperors, trying to gain control over both the Empire of the Night and its territory. This conflict lasted several months until finally, the Emperor of the Moon emerged victorious. With the support of most of the remaining allies, he claimed himself as the new supreme ruler of the entire continent. To commemorate his victory, he ordered the construction of a massive tower in the middle of the desert, where he planned to live out the rest of his days.
